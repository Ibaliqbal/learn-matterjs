# Learn Matter.js

This project is dedicated to learning and exploring the [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) physics engine library. Matter.js is a powerful and unique JavaScript library for creating 2D physics simulations in the browser. Through this project, I aim to understand the core concepts, features, and practical implementations of Matter.js by building various interactive demos and experiments.

## Features

- Hands-on examples using Matter.js
- Step-by-step explanations of physics concepts
- Experimentation with bodies, constraints, and collisions

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Open the demo files in your browser to see Matter.js in action.

## Resources

- [Official Matter.js Documentation](https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/)
